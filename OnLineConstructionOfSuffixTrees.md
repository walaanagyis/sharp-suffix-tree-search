On-line construction of suffix trees

# Algorithm notes #

  * We build the suffix tree of a string by building the suffix trees of the the string prefixes gradually as we scan the string from left to right, such that the suffix tree of the scanned part of the string is always ready. The generation of this tree in the described fashion is based on the simple observation that the suffixes of a string T(i) = t1, t2,..., ti can be obtained from the suffixes of the string T(i-1) = t1, t2, ..., ti-1 by concatenating the symbol ti at the of each suffix of T(i-1).

  * **Suffix links** are backward edges in the suffix tree that connect each node (which represents a suffix) to a 1 symbol shorter suffix of his ("Eyal" is linked to "yal" which is linked to "al").

  * **The boudary path** is the path generated by following the suffix links starting from the deepest state/node (longest suffix) until we reach the tree root.

  * In order to generate the suffix tree of T(i) from T(i-1), all we need to do is traverse the boundary path

  * No need to traverse
